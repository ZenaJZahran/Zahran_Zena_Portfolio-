# Zahran_Zena_Portfolio-
<<<<<<< HEAD

My name is Zena J. Zahran and a student at Full Sail University’s Mobile Development, BA program.  I am in the process of establishing an ePortfolio.  My current submissions have been based on past/ current class assignments – which include a few C# programming solutions projects created in Xamarin Studios that are truly in their infancy. I'm trying to build an online portfolio that I can be easily share with instructors and potential clients in the future.

When tackling any problems on lines of code or project I try to take a systematic approach. I think it's important to clarify the problem first, and get as much information as I can by collaborating with important stakeholders, before I start proposing possible solutions, often obtain feedback from my team.   I also try to think about what the best possible outcome might look like.   There are often times that it is prudent to use your team as a sounding board. 
 
In addition, I have transferred from FSU’s Graphic Design program and will includes sample imagery of my creations in Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign to includes a more creative dimension to my ePortfoilio.
