When tackling any problems on lines of code or project I try to take a systematic approach. I think it's important to clarify the problem first, and get as much information as I can by collaborating with important stakeholders, before I start proposing possible solutions, often obtain feedback from my team.   I also try to think about what the best possible outcome might look like.   There are often times that it is prudent to use your team as a sounding board.
